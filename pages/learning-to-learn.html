              <h2>Learning How to Learn</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
              As my career has progressed and I've gained experience through multiple different
              roles in tech, one thing has remained constant, learning. In the ever-changing world of tech, constant learning is inevitable for success and growth. One of
              the biggest issues is retaining what you've learned over years, and that's
              what this post is targeted towards. Years ago, one of my earliest
              mentors instilled the importance of understanding the psychology behind
              retention and effective learning strategies which is something I have used and will continue to
              use throughout the rest of my life. A lot of what I'm going to talk about
              are the findings from a German psychologist,
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Ebbinghaus" target="_blank"
                >Hermann Ebbinghaus,</a
              >
              who pioneered the experimental study of memory.

            </header>
            <p>
              The forgetting curve hypothesizes the decline of memory retention in
              relation to time. Ebbinghaus ran studies on himself to test how quickly he
              would forget something after learning it. He discovered that about 50% of
              all the information would be lost over the next 24 hours. After 24 hours,
              the forgetting rate became more gradual and about 90% would be lost within a
              week. During this test there was no attempt at retaining what was learned.
              The study was replicated in 2015 at the University of Amsterdam which
              produced results similar to Ebbinghaus's findings, which can be found
              <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4492928/#sec012" target="_blank">here.</a>

              When trying to learn something new by reading a book or watching a video
              and that's all you do in an attempt to learn and retain, it is almost
              pointless if you need to recall that information weeks or months later. Many people will choose to reread or rewatch videos as a way to study but not only does this take twice as much time, it's proven to be a <a href="https://site.nyit.edu/ctl/blog/retrieval_practice_a_more_effective_way_to_study" target="_blank">less effective way of studying.</a> 
              The question then becomes how do
              we flatten this curve and what's the best way of doing so? Factors like stress and sleep come into play, but the
              best and more effective way is through active recall
              and spaced repetition.

              <h2>What is Active Recall and Spaced Repetition?</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
              Active recall is a learning technique that involves actively engaging in the
              material you are trying to learn, rather than passively reviewing it.
              Examples of active recall include testing your memory and actively recalling
              information you just learned. Let's say you just finished
              reading the documentation on the
              <a
                href="https://nodejs.org/en/learn/asynchronous-work/event-loop-timers-and-nexttick" target="_blank"
                >Node.JS Event Loop.</a
              >
              After reading this section you should stop and actively quiz yourself on
              what you just learned without the information in front of you. This should
              be a more difficult experience and a lot of people actively avoid this
              because it isn't exactly pleasant, but the act of forcing the brain to
              recall will <a href="https://www.bcu.ac.uk/exams-and-revision/best-ways-to-revise/active-recall" target="_blank">strengthen the neural connections related to the information,
                improving long-term retention.</a> Flash cards are another great use of active
              recall.
              <br>
              <p>Spaced repetition involves reviewing information at increasing intervals over time. This approach is grounded in the forgetting curve, as it takes advantage of the natural way we forget information over time. To practice spaced repetition you should review new information shortly after you learn it, and then gradually increase the time between each review session. For example, you would review new information learned (ideally through active recall) on the day it's learned, then three days later, then a week later, and so on. Each review reinforces the information, helping to move it from short-term to long-term memory, thus flattening the curve.

              <h2>How I Practice These Concepts in My Daily Life</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Combining both these ideas of spaced repetition and active recall provides a very efficient way to study. I use a flash card app called <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" target="_blank">Anki</a> which does an excellent job joining these two ideas together. The app is designed to reinforce spaced repetition with how strongly or poorly you feel on a flash card and is something I practice for 15-20 minutes daily. When reviewing a flash card it will give you four choices (again, easy, medium, hard) to select from in order to turn the card over and view the answer. The more difficult the card was for you, the more frequently Anki will show it. As you continue working through cards and get more confident, the time can increase from weeks, to months, to even years. It is a software I strongly encourage anyone learning a new topic to use. Below is an example screenshot of the hundreds of Anki cards in my deck.
